# MusicForProgramming

Add a file that looks as follows in your `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRECTORY` to set your
download path:

`~/.config/music-for-programming/config.yml`:

```
download-path: /home/user/music/music-for-programming
```

The directory will automatically be created (along with any needed parent dirs).
